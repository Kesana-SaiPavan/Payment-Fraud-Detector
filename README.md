# Payment Fraud Detector (Real-Time) 

A beginner-friendly but production-ready **real-time fraud detection pipeline** I built to showcase skills required in fintech data engineering roles.

## What it does
- Simulates 10,000+ payment transactions per minute
- Flags fraud using 12 real-world rules (high amount, new device, velocity, etc.)
- Uses PySpark Structured Streaming + Delta Lake
- Generates real-time fraud alerts for Power BI / dashboards

## Tech Stack (exactly what companies ask)
Python • PySpark • Delta Lake • Databricks-style pattern • Great Expectations

## Quick Start (works in 30 seconds)
```bash
pip install pyspark pandas
python main.py
